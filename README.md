TITLE: CODE-CHALLENGE-1<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The assigment was a code challenge concerning three questions:
1: The first question was to create a program that changes marks of a student into grades:-

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
2 : The second question was to create a program that checks the speed of a car and if it exceeds the speed limit and the necessary action to take if a driver exceeds the speed limit either to revoke their license or charge them:-

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
3: The question was to create a program that calculates the gross salary by calculating the tax and benefits and the deductions one is supposed to pay:-

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

TO GO THE CODE YOU SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING:
To have a github account and a terminal or console to run the code.

INSTALLATION OF THE CODE
You can clone the code of the project from the github repo and clone it to your laptop
You can open the file in your terminal or console

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
On the end of the project, the functions have already been called so its just to input the values in each function and run the code on your terminal or on a console .
You can use the console in google chrome by going to the settings and go to the chrome developer tools and you will find the console there you just copr the code and run the tests.
