TITLE: CODE-CHALLENGE-1
DESCRIPTION
The assigment was a code challenge concerning three questions:
1: The first question was to create a program that changes marks of a student into grades:-

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
2 : The second question was to create a program that checks the speed of a car and if it exceeds the speed limit and the necessary action to take if a driver exceeds the speed limit either to revoke their license or charge them:-

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
